  <div>  In modern supply chain management, visualizing and analyzing food cold chain data is crucial for assessing and optimizing food safety. However, visualization expertise and efficient data access pose challenges for analysts. To address these issues, we propose VIS-Llama, an automated visualization generation model based on large language models (LLMs). VIS-Llama leverages the Llama2 model optimized with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology, trained on a dataset of 131,910 pairs from the Food Cold Chain Corpus to generate high-quality Vega-Lite visualizations. We evaluate VIS-Llama through quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality. Our web application provides convenient exploration services for cold chain analysts. Our contributions include the construction of the Food Cold Chain Corpus, development and optimization of VIS-Llama, and comprehensive evaluation through experiments and user studies. This work highlights the potential of LLMs for domain-specific data visualization and learning complex strategies.

  <!-- <strong>Our contributions are summarized as follows:</strong> 
  <br/> 
  <u>
    <strong>We've introduced an end-to-end automatic visualization generation model called VIS-Llama. </strong>
  </u>This model is based on the large language model Llama2 and utilizes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to train and optimize food cold chain data for the purpose of automatic visualization generation tasks.
  <br/> 
  <strong>
    <u>We've constructed a food cold chain corpus  </strong>
  </u> in collaboration with four cold chain professionals to conceptualize it. This corpus adopts tuples consisting of standardized JSON data and Vega-Lite encodings as input and output for model training and prediction, providing a reliable foundation for generating target sequences.
  <br/> 
  <strong>
    <u>We've developed an interactive system   </strong>
    </u>that allows users to upload JSON data and receive Vega-Lite visualization specifications generated by VIS-Llama. These visualizations are presented in chart form on the system interface for visual exploration.
    <br/>   
  <strong>
    <u>We've conducted comprehensive evaluations of the VIS-Llama model's performance through quantitative and qualitative experiments.   </strong>
    </u>Additionally, we've conducted user studies, validating the system's utility and usability through participant feedback, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of VIS-Llama in providing data visualization services. -->

  <br/>
  <strong>(a) Food Cold Chain Corpus Construction:</strong> Collect and integrate food cold chain data from various sources, clean the data, and build the comprehensive Food Cold Chain Corpus. <br/><strong>(b) VIS-Llama Model Development: </strong>Improve the quality of input data through feature processing, and then optimize the Llama2 model using LoRA technology with training data pairs extracted from the corpus to automatically generate visual content. 
  <br/>
  <strong>(c) Model Evaluation: </strong> Perform a comprehensive evaluation of the VIS-Llama model, assessing both text generation and visualization quality to confirm its applicability and reliability in the food cold chain domain. <br/><strong>(d) Visualization Application: </strong> Develop a web application based on the VIS-Llama model that enables users to generate the desired visualizations. Conduct visualization examples and user studies to assess the model's effectiveness.
